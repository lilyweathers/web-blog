    "content": "The world felt still today. I made coffee, opened the window, and let the soft light spill in. Sometimes that’s all we need — quiet and breath.\n\nI keep learning that attention is a lantern: turn it toward anything, and the ordinary brightens like a stage. At the window the rain practiced its handwriting, long cursive lines that turned the neighborhood into a watercolor I could breathe.\n\nIt turns out most of my favorite moments can’t be photographed; they happen in the breath between noticing and naming.",
